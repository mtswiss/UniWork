1. What are Joe's security expectations for this system?

Joe expects that by downloading by truste sites he will be safe. He is wrong about that, even though the software
he uses to download other applications and softwares are safe, he can not be 100% sure that his downloads
are malware-safe. He also makes the decision to install only things from a CD. His assumption is that ".exe" files
downloaded from the net contains virus. He howere doesn't take into consideration that on the CD he has there might
be a malware that infiltrates the computer when he executes the ".exe" from the CD. Using Internet Explorer 6 is
not safe. There are later versions However, Joe needs to make sure that when he does make banking and other 
transactions on the web that the website is secure (a small lock at the bottom of the page). 
Microsoft Word/Excel docs with macros might not be safe. Macro is like an excutable program.
