*** PICAXE FIRMWARE REVISION SUMMARY ***

For each size PICAXE IC the firmware code is shown on screen
after a successful download. The code is in the style of A.B
where A = the base firmware size code ID
  and B = the firmware revision number.

Note that some firmware revision codes are internal quality
control  changes, not modifications of the firmware. This is 
normally when the brand of gang programmer used for programming
the PICAXE bootstrap is changed.
